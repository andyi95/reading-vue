  "sourceText": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister\\non the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had\\npeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no\\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'\\nthought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\\n\\n  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,\\nfor the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether\\nthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble\\nof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\\n\\n  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice\\nthink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to\\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
